### uvData (**help wanted**)
uvData is a JavaScript based data manipulation library which acts on a ist of JSON Object (a list of tuples). It is still work in progress and can be used to do complex operations on data.

Together with uvCharts, it will provide enough options to play around with data and visualize it in whichever way you want to see it.
